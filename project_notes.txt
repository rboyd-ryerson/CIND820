spatial clustering using x,y,z

preclassified ground points are removed

point intensity also to be used which can provide information about the composition of the surface

can be combined with imagery of the same location and utilize the rgb values from the image as well

Imagery is georeferenced so that rgb values can be extracted using the x,y,z values

attributes:

x,y,z,intensity,r,g,b, return number, total returns, 

dbscan parameters:

epsilon: minimum distance between points to be joined to a given cluster, depends on resolution of lidar which is 7 ppm so

1m/7pts = 0.15cm is the average distance between all points (including ground), so it depends how far the objects will be from each other. 1m could be a good starting point and adjust as needed, hopefully this will not create one huge cluster of all the points, but if ground is removed, it should be ok

min_points: minimum number of points required to form a cluster, should be relavitively high for this purpose
